Final Project Quantified Cognition: Option 0

The Notebook is titled "Option_0_QC" --> you can view the output within the Notebook format, but I 
definitely recommend opening with Colab.

Since I have uploaded the two .csv files to GitHub, they have a raw data url.

The first is titled **cell_regions_excel**

The second is titled **Bird_region_stim_count**

Both of these urls I used in the code already.
