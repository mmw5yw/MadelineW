Final Project Quantified Cognition: Option 0

The Notebook is titled "Option_0_QC" --> you can view the output within the Notebook format, but I 
definitely recommend opening with Colab.

The two CSV files must be downloaded to the user's device, to be able to import the data into the code as directed within. 

It shouldn't matter where the files are downloaded to within the computer, as long as they maintain .csv format,
the same file name, and are callable by finder (like a regular document).

The first is titled **cell_regions_excel**

The second is titled **Birds_region_stim_count**
